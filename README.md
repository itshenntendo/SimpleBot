# SimpleBot
SimpleBot is a basic Discord.py bot, that only needs a name, a token, and Discord.py to work!
# Requirements
You need a Discord account, with a bot profile created. Put that token in the file. And give the bot a name in the bot_name variable.. add the bot to your server and run! If it's setup right, it'll return your ping!
